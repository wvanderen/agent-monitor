# Agent Monitor - Next Phase Plan Summary

## What Was Created 📝

**File:** `NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md`

A comprehensive 5-phase roadmap for Agent Monitor, from basic monitoring to full AI orchestration.

## What You Can Ralph Now 🐱

### Option 1: Phase 2 - Intelligence Layer (Recommended)

```bash
cd /home/lem/dev/agent_monitor
npm run ralpher -- _bmad/stories/intelligence-layer.story.md
```

**Story File:** `_bmad/stories/intelligence-layer.story.md` ✅ Created

**Effort:** 2-3 days

**Value:** 10x improvement - transforms "monitor" into "understand"

---

### Option 2: Phase 3 - Tool Integration

```bash
cd /home/lem/dev/agent_monitor
npm run ralpher -- _bmad/stories/tool-integration.story.md
```

**Story File:** `_bmad/stories/tool-integration.story.md` ✅ Created

**Effort:** 3-4 days

**Value:** Actionable alerts instead of just alerts

---

### Option 3: Phase 5 - Dashboard (Can run in parallel)

Lower effort, good for demos and visualization.

**Effort:** 4-6 days

**Value:** Real-time metrics and incident management UI

---

## Parallel Strategy

While you fix Catalyst tests:

| Your Work | Parallel Work |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fix Catalyst tests | **Agent Monitor Phase 2** (Intelligence Layer) |
| Fix Catalyst tests | **Agent Monitor Phase 5** (Dashboard) |

Recommended: Start Phase 2 first (medium effort, high value), then Phase 5 (low effort).

## Story Files Ready

| Story | File | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Intelligence Layer | `_bmad/stories/intelligence-layer.story.md` | ✅ Ready |
| Tool Integration | `_bmad/stories/tool-integration.story.md` | ✅ Ready |

## What This Builds

```
HTTP Monitoring (Current)
     ↓
AI-Powered Monitoring with Intelligence (Phase 2)
     ↓
Notification Tools + Automated Remediation (Phase 3)
     ↓
Multi-Agent Orchestration + Conversation History (Phase 4)
     ↓
Real-time Dashboard with Incident Management (Phase 5)
     ↓
Self-Healing AI Systems (Auto-diagnose + Auto-fix)
```

This transforms Agent Monitor from a tool into an intelligent, autonomous system. 🚀
